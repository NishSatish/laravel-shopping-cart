## Shoppy

A shopping cart app built in PHP with Laravel. Stores the cart in sessions, but the final order is stored in the database. Here's what you should do after you clone:

- Run ```php artisan key:generate``` in the terminal to generate an encryption key
- Install all dependencies with ```composer install``` and ```npm install```
- Rename the file renameto.env to .env
- Create a database with a MySQL client and enter the credentials into the .env file. For using the payments API, grab an API key from Stripe and enter it in the same file
- To create tables, run ```php artisan migrate```
